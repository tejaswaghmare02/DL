It was proposed by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943 as an attempt to capture the basic functionality of neurons in a mathematical and computational framework. This model played a foundational role in the development of artificial neural networks.\n","\n","**Key Concepts:**\n","\n","1. **Binary Model:** The McCulloch-Pitts neuron is a binary model, meaning it operates in a discrete manner. It only produces two possible output states: firing (activation) or not firing (no activation).\n","\n","2. **Inputs and Weights:** The neuron receives inputs from external sources or other neurons. Each input is associated with a weight that signifies the importance of that input. These weights can be adjusted during learning.\n","\n","3. **Activation Function:** The neuron computes the weighted sum of its inputs. If this weighted sum crosses a certain threshold, the neuron fires (outputs 1); otherwise, it remains inactive (outputs 0).\n","\n","4. **Threshold:** The threshold is a predefined value. If the weighted sum of inputs exceeds the threshold, the neuron activates; otherwise, it doesn't.\n","\n","**Mathematical Representation:**\n","\n","Given inputs \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\) with corresponding weights \\(w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n\\) and a threshold \\(T\\), the output \\(y\\) of the McCulloch-Pitts neuron is determined as follows:\n","\n","\\\n","\\begin{cases}\n","y = 1, & \\text{if } \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i \\geq T \\\\\n","y =0, & \\text{otherwise}\n","\\end{cases}\n","\n","\n","**Significance:**\n","\n","The McCulloch-Pitts neuron laid the groundwork for understanding the basic principles of computation in neural networks. While it is a simplified model that lacks the full complexity of biological neurons, it introduced the concepts of weighted inputs, thresholds, and binary outputs. This model paved the way for subsequent developments like the perceptron, which extended the M-P neuron by incorporating adjustable weights and bias terms.\n","\n","**Limitations:**\n","\n","While influential, the McCulloch-Pitts neuron has limitations. It cannot learn from data and lacks the ability to perform complex computations or represent more intricate functions. It serves as a foundational concept that sparked interest in developing more sophisticated neuron models and neural network architectures."],"metadata":{"id":"HhLZkQk5DV-3"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ECRNRk6HIRKQ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Implementation using Tensorflow"],"metadata":{"id":"fTT6Nw-PDI-K"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"oe3OUyue71g3","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1691261140272,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":733,"user":{"displayName":"ABHISHEK SWAMI","userId":"09000310416677296322"}},"outputId":"8989cb87-6e67-4bcb-b4b1-837c56d0315f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Input Data:\n"," [[0 0]\n"," [0 1]\n"," [1 0]\n"," [1 1]]\n","AND Gate Output:\n"," [0 0 0 1]\n"]}],"source":["# Implementation of AND gate using M-P Neuron\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","\n","def mcCullochPittsNeuron(input_data,weights,threshold):\n","  weighted_sum=tf.reduce_sum(input_data*weights,axis=1)\n","  output=tf.where(weighted_sum>=threshold,1,0)\n","  return output\n","\n","# Define the input data (truth table for AND gate)\n","input_data = tf.constant([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]])\n","\n","# Define the weights\n","weights = tf.constant([1, 1])\n","\n","output=mcCullochPittsNeuron(input_data,weights,2)\n","print(\"Input Data:\\n\",input_data.numpy())\n","print(\"AND Gate Output:\\n\",output.numpy())\n"]}]}
